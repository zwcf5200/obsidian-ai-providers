# Obsidian AI Providers

⚠️ Important Note:
This plugin is a configuration tool - it helps you manage your AI settings in one place.

Think of it like a control panel where you can:
- Store your API keys and settings for AI services
- Share these settings with other Obsidian plugins
- Avoid entering the same AI settings multiple times

**The plugin itself doesn't do any AI processing - it just helps other plugins connect to AI services more easily.**
